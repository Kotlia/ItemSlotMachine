	Write [CoinShop] in the first line of a sign and click done, now it'll create a coin shop sign automagically! You can change the amount of coins you want to buy by pointing at the sign and scrolling up/down for increasing/decreasing the amount. (if you hold shift while scrolling the amount will increase/decrease by 10) After you've chosen the amount of coins you want to buy right click it.
